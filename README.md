# Anvil-PID-Tuner
A simple TVC Model Rocket simulator that allows the user to manually tune his PID controller

This software is not designed to give you 100% accurate PID values, it is only designed to give ballpark values.
Use at your own risk

Some information about the sliders:
Kp, Kd, and Inertia are all multiplied by 100, ie: if the slider says Kp = 115, Kp is actually 1.15

One more thing, When you download the exe, Windows will do everything in its power to make sure that you don't open it.
I promise that there are no malicious things included with the exe file.
