# Anvil-PID-Tuner
A simple TVC Model Rocket simulator that allows the user to manually tune his PID controller

This software is not designed to give you 100% accurate PID values, it is only designed to give ballpark values.
Use at your own risk

Some information about the sliders:
Kp, Kd, and Inertia are all multiplied by 100, ie: if the slider says Kp = 115, Kp is actually 1.15

One more thing, I am trying to make an exe file to make it easier for people to use, but I am having troubles with file sizes.
I will try to get that working in the next few days
